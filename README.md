Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates binary classification using logistic regression. The script reads data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and applies logistic regression to classify the data. The results are visualized using matplotlib.

Requirements
To run this script, you need the following Python libraries installed:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
Dataset
The dataset used in this script is stored in a CSV file named dataset.csv. The dataset should have the following structure:

The first two columns represent the features (e.g., salary and experience).

The third column represents the binary labels (e.g., 0 for "no" and 1 for "yes").

Code Explanation
1. Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing necessary libraries:

numpy for numerical operations.

pandas for data manipulation.

matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization.

2. Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function is defined to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which is useful for logistic regression:

python
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
3. Loading and Preprocessing Data
The dataset is loaded from dataset.csv and preprocessed:

The data is reshaped to separate features (x) and labels (y).

A bias term (column of ones) is added to the feature matrix.

4. Initializing Weights
The weights for the logistic regression model are initialized:

python
w = np.array([0., 0.1, 0.1]).reshape(-1, 1)
5. Training the Model
The logistic regression model is trained using gradient descent:

The cost function is computed using the logistic loss.

The weights are updated iteratively to minimize the cost function.

6. Visualizing the Results
The decision boundary is plotted along with the data points to visualize the classification results:

python
plt.scatter(x[:10, 0], x[:10, 1], c='red', edgecolors='none', s=30, label='yes')
plt.scatter(x[10:, 0], x[10:, 1], c='blue', edgecolors='none', s=30, label='no')
plt.legend(loc=1)
plt.xlabel('salary')
plt.ylabel('exp')
plt.show()
7. Saving and Loading Weights
The trained weights are saved to a file (w_logistic.npy) for future use:

python
np.save('w_logistic.npy', w)
The weights can be loaded later using:

python
w = np.load('w_logistic.npy')
Running the Script
To run the script, simply execute the Python file in your terminal or IDE:

bash
python binary_classification.py
Notes
Ensure that the dataset.csv file is in the same directory as the script.

The script assumes that the dataset is already preprocessed and clean.

The learning rate (alpha) and number of iterations (step) can be adjusted for better performance.
